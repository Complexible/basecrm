# Base CRM Java API

A basic Java implementation of the [Base CRM API](https://dev.futuresimple.com/api).

Current version is 0.1 on 2015-03-31. We're using [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
for development.

Sadly, there are no tests.  There is no sandbox to use for Base, so it requires a live Base account.  The code was
written as part of a larger application which integrated with Base, so it's been tested extensively, albeit, indirectly.
